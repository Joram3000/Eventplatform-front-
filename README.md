Event Platform group project

A website for artists and fans to see which events are scheduled with the option to buy tickets.


Features:
  As an artist you can post events and sell tickets, providing information such as the date and location of the event. 
  
  There is also an artist profile page. If the artist has a Spotify account it will be shown here.
  
  
  
On the process
we worked on different branches implementing and writing components

What was the biggest challenge
merging without colissions, working simultaniously is a bigger challenge than working alone on a project.
